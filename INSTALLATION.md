# Installation

The desktop application requires a the file `OpenHardwareMonitorLib.dll`.

This file needs to exist in the same directory as the .exe file.

You can find it within the [OpenHardwareMonitor](https://openhardwaremonitor.org/) Installation. 

Just open the archive and extract it into the needed directory.

## Notice
I used the version 0.9.5 and it worked, for any problems just open an issue.
